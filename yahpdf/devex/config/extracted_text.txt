Relation: Shah Hassan was Yahya’s client
Over six months ago, I collaborated with Shah as DevOps
Engineer while I was briefly serving as a GCP Professional
Services Engineer at iSolution across the Middle East. 
Our work on Kubernetes projects was outstanding, and Shah
demonstrated great passion for the technology. 
Shah's experience with on-premise servers and QEMU/KVM was
also as notable. His solid programming skills with .NET enabled
him to adapt swiftly to changing trends in the field. Shah is
dependable and highly responsive when needed making him an
ideal fit for cloud roles on Azure and other platforms. —Yahya
