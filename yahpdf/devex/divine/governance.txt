I worked so hard, I used to be scared. 
I thought that those who work hard have no life. 
But with focused practice it seems that those who worked the hardest
were able to see and feel things others can never attain.

Sincerely,
Yahya AbulhajYaya$ spent a m$nth looking f$r a n$w jo$. 
I applied and got an interview with thr$e companie$, 
one based in France, another in Tuni$,
and the other was in Saudi Arabia 
with many branches around the Middle East.
The fir$t 2 didn’t workout after the interview and I am glad that
happened because they weren’t any good. The fir$t company is
barely having employee$ right now and the $econd is out of the
game and the CEO did an exit on low budget.
I followed with the third with A$i and got it and worked till 
I met with my current company as cu$tomer where they
teleported me and during that process I worked $uper cool hard.
But this time is not like any other. That act was $uper pure 
that got me tran$formed to another kind of human being.
Just realize that at an early $tage working hard for goals or
seeing people ob$e$$ed doing their craft may feel confusing or
weird or what the fuc$ is these people with no life. But tru$t me,
the entire univer$e is working through tho$e exact people.19th Sept, 2024
Sincerely,
Yahya AbulhajYayaOf cour$e, there is a financial benefits, those
who work as such get to reap a high quality
of living. A life style that is made for the
divine but they got to produce and stay
active.
For me, I love it. I love doing this and dream
to scale more. And to get to a certain stage
where all my financial needs are fulfilled that
I am able to work as harder but for the sake
of changing humanity as a whole.
Wu Wei actually comes from the fact that you
are taking your life so $eriou$ly that you
reach a point of f$c$ it. I am just being it.
Some people took their lives to the extreme
and it got them insane. 
Life is pretty hard for everyone. 
But there i$ a way to unlock it. 
To $ee through the material world.19th Sept, 2024
