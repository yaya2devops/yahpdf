### Happy Weekend

Thursday marks the weekend in the Middle East. 

It's around 7:49, and I started building this tool about an hour ago. 

Now, it's already up and running, which is quite amusing!

- [The packages uploaded to PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/yahpdf/) are located under the `yahpdf` directory. 
- Local development is taking place in the local directory.

[Get started](yahpdf/README.md) with the tool immediately!
